# Victory by Armada

Many moons ago, a product called VBAM: the Starmada Edition was published by a collaboration of VBAM Games and Majestic Twelve Games, the publishers of VBAM and Starmada, respectively. It provided all the rules necessary to use Starmada X as the tactical combat system for a VBAM game.

By the time I acquired a copy, Starmada X had been succeeded by the Admiralty Edition. I made an attempt to update the Starmada bits to the Admiralty Edition to run my own campaigns, but never truly finished.

And now both VBAM and Starmada have gone through two more versions each. So this is my attempt to update my previous rules to the current versions of both games.
